Once upon a time, Larry the llama got tired of his usual routine at the petting zoo and decided to spice things up. He’d always wondered what it was like to be a human, so he “borrowed” a janitor’s cap and strolled right out the front gate. Trotting down the street, he found a coffee shop and tried to order a latte, but all he got were startled looks and a bunch of selfies taken by people saying, “Look, a llama barista!” Frustrated, Larry tried to explain he just wanted a little adventure. But as he turned to leave, someone slipped him a carrot muffin. Satisfied with his “human experience,” he trotted back to the zoo, where he now claims he once worked as a barista "in the city."
